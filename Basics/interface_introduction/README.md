## Remix is composed of a number of panels.

Most of the plugins appear in the **Side Panel**. Editing happens in tabs in the **Main Panel**. Switching between plugins happens in the **Icons Panel**.

Try clicking another icon in the **Icons Panel** to go to another plugin.  Try finding the **Solidity Compiler** and then the **Deploy & Run** plugin.  Then come back **LearnEth**.

In the **main panel** of Remix, make sure you see the **Home tab**.  The Home tab has lots of usefule links. To navigate to there, click the Remix icon ![Remix icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/remix-workshops/master/Basics/1._Interface_introduction/images/remix-logo.png "Remix icon") on the top of the icon panel.

- In the **Featured Plugins** section of the **Home tab**, click the **Solidity** button.  This button will activate a number of plugins - youâ€™ll see them in the icon panel (if they haven't already been activated).

- Alternatively, you can activate plugins one at a time with the **Plugin Manager**. ![plugin manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/remix-workshops/master/Basics/1._Interface_introduction/images/plugin1.png "Plugin Manager icon")
